#### A consulting firm repeatedly builds large architecture for their customers using AWS resources from several AWS services including IAM, Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, DynamoDB and Amazon VPC. The consultants have architecture diagrams for each of their architectures, and are frustrated that they cannot automatically create their resources. Service that will immediately benefit to the organization is:
  * AWS Cloudformation. 
    * Cloudformation enables consultants to user their architecture diagrams to construct CloudFormation templates. 
    * Cloudformation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Service resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your application that run on AWS. You can create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instance or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. 
    
#### An organization hosts a multi-language website on AWS, which is served using CloudFront. Language is specified in the HTTP request as shown below:
  * http://d11111f8.cloudfront.net/main.html?language=de
  * http://d11111f8.cloudfront.net/main.html?language=en
  * http://d11111f8.cloudfront.net/main.html?language=es
  
  **How should AWS Cloudfront be configured to deliver cache data in the correct language?**
   * Based on query string parameter
#### A Solution Architect is designing a shared service for hosting containers from several customers on Amazon ECS. These containers will use several AWS service. A container from one customer should not be able to access data from another customer. Which of the below solutions should the architect use to meet these requirements?
  * IAM roles for tasks
    * With IAM roles for Amazon ECS tasks, you can specify an IAM role to be used by the containers in a task. Applications are required to sign their AWS API requests with AWS credentials, and this feature provides a strategy to manage credentials for your application's use. This is similar to how Amazon EC2 instance profiles provide credentials to EC2 instances. 
  
#### There is a requirement to host a database on a EC2 Instance. It is also required that the EBS volume should support 12,000 IOPS. Which Amazon EBS volume type meets the performance requirement.
  * EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD
     * For high performance and high requirement as in this case, the ideal choice would be EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD. Suitable for large database workloads, such as MongoDB, Cassandra, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle. 
     * Genereal purpose SSD(gp2), on the other hand, is recommended for most wide variety of workloads, system boot volumes, virtual desktops, low-latency interactive apps, development and test environment.
