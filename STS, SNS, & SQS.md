#### SQS guide
  * When a customer receives and processes a message from a queue, the message remains in the queue. AWS SQS doesn't automatically delete the message.
  * SQS is a distributed system, there's no gurantee that the customer actually receives the message( for ex, due to connectivity issue, or due to an issue in the consumer application). Thus, the customer must delete the message from the queue after receiving and processing it.
